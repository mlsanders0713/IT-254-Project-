# IT-254-Project-

My project is an LED alarm clock designed to combine funcitonality with simplicity using Arduino programming. It would feather an LED light dispaly to show the current time, buttons to sent and adjust the alarm, a speaker for the alarm sound, and a light sensor that automatically dims the display at night and brightens it during the day. The project would require the following items and hardware: an Arduino Uno board, LED display module, push buttons, buzzer/speaker,  light sensor, breadboard, wires, and a power supply.
